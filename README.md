# opstodo
Once upon a time in a [techygrrrl's stream](https://twitch.tv/techygrrrl) a suggestion directed towards me as a joke and learning project: a todo list with yaml backend called Opstodo (joke explanation: everything is in yaml in Ops).
So this is gonna be built with Go + Cobra + bubbletea.

yay!
